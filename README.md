# Pixel-it

Think about retro fonts, about the 8-bit images, the journey to the past, the games you love and the feeling they give you. Welcome, to the firefox estension that makes all of that with the click of a button. 

### So how does it work?

Its actually pretty simple considering what the average level of developing a firefox extension is. It uses the Mozilla API and suggestions in the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions).

#### What about the technology it uses?

Its mainly Javascript. There is some css and html in it too, and some json as well, as with webdevelopment with js normally is.

### Things to improve:
- [x] Make it work
- [ ] Support the user choosing the font
- [ ] Be able to have various themes to choose from
- [ ] Make it brew fresh coffee
- [ ] Automize it to fetch my ever missing lost sock

### Why open source? Why not win a quick buck with it?
We believe that open code is the best code. This doesn't really escalate to a business, and even if it did, we are just a group of friends that enjoy developing and learning new things every day! So enjoy all you like this amazing extension we created.

### Cool. I'm digging it. But how do I use it? Yelling at my computer helps?

Maybe. Try doing it alone preferably. Until Mozilla approves our extension to place it in the add-on store, you can clone this repository and follow these steps to install it:

###### Step 1

* Go to your browser and if it Firefox type in the URL "about:debugging". If it isn't sorry, instructions are coming soon.
###### Step 2  

* Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and choose ``manifest.json`` in the file you just downloaded.
###### Step 3 
* Enjoy the hell out of it!

### Love it. Need it. Who can I thank and how can I help?
